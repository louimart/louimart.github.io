    <p>Hi, I'm a Project Designer with a wide range of experience in building design, documentation, project coordination, and visualization within the Architectural industry.  I hope to learn new skills involving coding and software development to further advance my career by leveraging IT skills and supporting the growing needs in the industry. When I am not working on architectural or visualization projects, you can find me working with my 3D printer and desktop CNC machine making anything from small wooden items to custom knife scales for pocket knives. Seeing how various coding languages are used to control these machines, I have been very fascinated and excited to dive into the software development world.
I hope to find a challenging position where I can combine my wide range of skills and knowledge to create new solutions to the problems we face today. I also look forward to the journey of working with people from different industries and making new meaningful connections.
